short messages that can have a long-term impact on how
scientists create and publish ideas. We investigate the
usefulness of Twitter in the development and distribution
of scientific knowledge. At the start of the 'life
cycle' of a scientific publication, Twitter provides a
large virtual department of colleagues that can help to
rapidly generate, share and refine new ideas. As ideas
become manuscripts, Twitter can be used as an informal
arena for the pre-review of works in progress. Finally,
tweeting published findings can communicate research
to a broad audience of other researchers, decision makers,
journalists and the general public that can amplify
the scientific and social impact of publications. However,
there are limitations, largely surrounding issues of
intellectual property and ownership, inclusiveness and
misrepresentations of science ‘sound bites’. Nevertheless,
we believe Twitter is a useful social media tool that
can provide a valuable contribution to scientific publishing
in the 21st century},

Examples of student work are presented along with discussion of lessons learned and recommendations for the use of this method in the future.

This paper describes our semester-long experimental study to determine if using Twitter – the microblogging and social networking platform most amenable to ongoing, public dialogue – for educationally relevant purposes can impact college student engagement and grades. A total of 125 students taking a first year seminar course for pre-health professional majors participated in this study (70 in the experimental group and 55 in the control group). With the experimental group, Twitter was used for various types of academic and co-curricular discussions. Engagement was quantified by using a 19-item scale based on the National Survey of Student Engagement. To assess differences in engagement and grades, we used mixed effects analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) models, with class sections nested within treatment groups. We also conducted content analyses of samples of Twitter exchanges. The {ANOVA} results showed that the experimental group had a significantly greater increase in engagement than the control group, as well as higher semester grade point averages. Analyses of Twitter communications showed that students and faculty were both highly engaged in the learning process in ways that transcended traditional classroom activities. This study provides experimental evidence that Twitter can be used as an educational tool to help engage students and to mobilize faculty into a more active and participatory role.},

	abstract = {{\textbar}From a science perspective, inquiry-oriented instruction engages students in the investigative nature of science. Inquiry involves activity and skills, but the focus is on the active search for knowledge or understanding to satisfy a curiosity. This digest further describes the distinguishing features of inquiry-oriented science instruction and provides a review of the literature on the benefits of teaching through inquiry. This document emphasizes that an emphasis on inquiry-oriented teaching does not necessarily preclude the use of textbooks or other instructional materials. As instructional technology advances, there will be more options for using a variety of materials to enrich inquiry-oriented instruction. (Contains 42 references.) ({PR}){\textbar}},

	abstract = {Traditional engineering instruction is deductive, beginning with theories and progressing to the applications of those theories. Alternative teaching approaches are more inductive. Topics are introduced by presenting specific observations, case studies or problems, and theories are taught or the students are helped to discover them only after the need to know them has been established. This study reviews several of the most commonly used inductive teaching methods, including inquiry learning, problem-based learning, project-based learning, case-based teaching, discovery learning, and just-in-time teaching. The paper defines each method, highlights commonalities and specific differences, and reviews research on the effectiveness of the methods. While the strength of the evidence varies from one method to another, inductive methods are consistently found to be at least equal to, and in general more effective than, traditional deductive methods for achieving a broad range of learning outcomes.},

	abstract = {{\textbar}This monograph examines the nature of active learning at the higher education level, the empirical research on its use, the common obstacles and barriers that give rise to faculty resistance, and how faculty and staff can implement active learning techniques. A preliminary section defines active learning and looks at the current climate surrounding the concept. A second section, entitled "The Modified Lecture" offers ways that teachers can incorporate active learning into their most frequently used format: the lecture. The following section on classroom discussion explains the conditions and techniques needed for the most useful type of exchange. Other ways to promote active learning are also described including: visual learning, writing in class, problem solving, computer-based instruction, cooperative learning, debates, drama, role playing, simulations, games, and peer teaching. A section on obstacles to implementing active learning techniques leads naturally to the final},
